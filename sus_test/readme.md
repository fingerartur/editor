# SUS test
Employees of -anonymized- from the team working on ERAIN assessed the usability of this prototype
in comparison with the original software. They were given 6 tasks to complete, filled in
a survery and recorded the time taken to complete each task. (link to [SUS](https://measuringu.com/sus/))

Tasks that the testers had to complete are [here](tasks.md).

## Collected survey results
- results of SUS questionaire for the original software are [here](sus_answers_original.csv)
- results of SUS questionaire for the new prototype are [here](sus_answers_new.csv)
- times taken to complete each task are [here](tasks_times.csv)

## Conclusion
- Usability has very slightly increased, it can be considered the same.
- The usability of both versions is considered bad by the general SUS scale (SUS score cca 25 - less usable than most other software products). The reason for this low score is that the task that this software performs is very complex, which makes the users feel overwhelmed.
- Tasks can be performed up to twice as fast using the new prototype.

## Environment
*It is not possible to reproduce the test without access permissions from -anonymized-. And in order to reproduce
the test environment inside this prototype it is necessary to use dedicated mock data located in ```./mockData```*
