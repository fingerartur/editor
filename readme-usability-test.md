# TODO
- vzkouset par veci na starem -anonymized-u a zjistit zda dava smysl porovnavat stary s novym
- otazky napsat programovacim jazykem. Nejcastejsi je vyrabeni vyrazu (pouziti dokumentu atd.) a pak prichazi, pohyb v pravidle
(zoom/pan/collapse/find invalid) a copy/paste (presun z vetve jinam) a delete

- pokud stary -anonymized- dava smysl srovnavat:
    - udelat stejne vstupni dokumenty
    - udelat stejne operace?


# TODO idea
- ukolem bylo webovej prototyp, nikoliv zlepseni UX - to je jen evaluacni bonus


# What people to pick?
- Those that never used any version of -anonymized-. Trained people will hate on the new UI just because they
are used to the old UI.
- programmers. They will understand the concept.

# How to prepare them?
- tell them the concept, give them a list of useful features but let them
find them on their own (copy paste, undo / redo). It is OK to tell them about
the features, because ERAIN users get instruction videos anyway.

# interpretation:
- SUS should be taken by 15 people to be reliable. I will do it for 2 (simplified SUS).
- calculate SUS score, see if -anonymized-2 has higher score than -anonymized-1
- Bonus: compare times
- Bonus: use Jeff Sauro's curve created from 500 SUS tests and see how many of those 500
	are worse than ERAIN2 (percentile of goodness)

# Exercises
- the number of execrises does not matter. What matters is that users try the stuff that
-anonymized- is most usually used for / what it's intended for.
